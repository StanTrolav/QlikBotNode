# QlikBotNode
- QlikBotNode is a server build in Node.js, Express.js, Enigma.js and MySql that connects to chat and media platforms like Telegram, Skype, MS Teams, Cortana, Slack, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. 
- It connects to MySql and stores the users for a mass messaging at any time
- Commands are case sensitive

# Getting started

### Prerequisites 

Before continuing, make sure that you have these tools installed:

- Node.js >= 8.2.1
- MySql CE >=5 (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) 
- Git bash if on Windows
- Certificates for running https. If your environment is dev, then you can export from Qlik Sense Enterprise for "localhost" in a "Platform Independent PEM-format". Save them under app/server/certs/localhost/
![Exporting Certificates with Sense](/screenshots/general/export-certificates.png?raw=true "Exporting Certificates with Sense")
- QVFs needed:
	- Helpdesk: This comes with every Qlik Sense Desktop installation. You will find it under C:\Users\{username}\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Apps\Helpdesk Management.qvf
	- Salesforce: https://github.com/yianni-ververis/Salesforce/tree/master/Files
	- CIO Dashboard: https://github.com/yianni-ververis/CIO/tree/master/Files
- Once uploaded to the Qlik Sense Enterprise, get the app ids from the QMC and with the your host DNS put them in the app/server/config.json. 
    - Make sure that the apps are published.
    - Make sure that the host name is the same as the folder name under your certs. Enigma.js will read the certs from there to connect to your engine and authenticate users.

And know at least some of these web technologies:

- JavaScript
- Promises
- Websockets

### Usage

- To start, install all necessary packages
```javascript
npm install -g gulp
npm install
```

- Install all the required Environmental variables for each of the chat platforms.
	- For Windows, go to "Control Panel" -> "System" -> "Advanced System Settings" -> "Environment Variables"
	- For Linux, from your directory (~), type "nano .bash_profile" or "vim .bash_profile" and enter the variables there like 
		- "export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=######"

- For Database storage and mass Instant Messaging, create a database and run the files/sensebot.sql

- Then, 
	- for local testing, type gulp or,
	- for production, run the server with [forever.js](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) by typing 
	```javascript
	forever start foreverConfig.json
	```
	- Make sure you have the right certificates under app/server/certs/


This will start your server at https://localhost:3000
